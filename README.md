# Local Hadoop Cluster
This project creates a small local Hadoop cluster using [Cloudera Manager 6.3.0](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/manager/6-3-0.html) on a [CentOS 7.6](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso) base.

Refer to the [vSphere page](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/local-hadoop/wiki/vSphere) of how the server configuration was done on the physical hardware.
